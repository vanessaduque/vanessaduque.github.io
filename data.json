      "description": "The work results from an extensive collection and visual record of images generated by denim representations and associations within the culture. \n The project acts as a multi-disciplinary discussion and moving scenarios in contemporary culture; The fashion context; And the integration of designed objects into everyday situations. \n The research expands on the notion of abstracting the semiotic of denim archetypes; Reflecting on the process of isolating the elements of denim associations, and questioning how its parts play a role in collective perceptions—and speculating a new definition of denim. \n The meaning behind the outcomes is to interrogate how the signs of fashion artifacts signify and how denim visual notions become dynamic. These outcomes intentionally open space for discussion and an opportunity for the recollection of multiple collective perceptions. Also, an interplay of 'reciprocal language' always relates to denim's imaginary, technology, production, and replication. Each project within the work acts as a reflection and intervention upon its foundations. Moreover, It rewrites and creates narratives by finding evidence self-contained. \n A continually shifting system developed the process. from fashion context, everyday design, and denim design principles that intentionally leave room for interpretation, and, by suggesting multiple readings and experimenting with 'denim' applications in contemporary culture.",
